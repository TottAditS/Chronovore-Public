<h3>Game Description</h3>
<p align="justify">Chronovore is a 3D hack-and-slash action RPG where time is your only life force. As time constantly ticks down, players must fight through hordes of enemies to reclaim the precious seconds needed to survive. Every hit, kill, and combo adds time, but with each mistake, time slips away. The player wields the unique power to stop time for brief moments, gaining an edge in combat or evading deathâ€”but using this power comes at the cost of your remaining life. Set in a peaceful, yet monstrous world, Chronovore challenges you to manage your time and skillfully battle through a relentless struggle for survival.

<h3>Target Audience</h3>
<p align="justify">Chronovore targets gamers aged 13-40 who are drawn to intense, challenging combat and dark, atmospheric worlds. These players enjoy games like Dark Souls that require precise timing and mastery of mechanics. They seek a rewarding experience where skill, quick decision-making, and perseverance are key to success. Fans of action RPGs with complex systems, especially those who appreciate high-risk, high-reward gameplay, will be captivated by Chronovore's unique time-based survival mechanics. The game appeals to those who enjoy exploring mysterious worlds, where every battle feels like a test of endurance.</p>

# Game Mechanics My Team Created

<h3>Movement</h3>
<p align="justify">In Chronovore, player movement is designed to give players full control in a 3D third-person perspective. You can walk, sprint, dodge-roll, and jump, allowing for precise navigation through detailed environments and combat scenarios. The ability to lock onto enemies makes battles focused and tactical, with dodging or sidestepping critical for avoiding incoming attacks.</p>


<h3>Combat</h3>

- The character wields a sword, hacking and slashing in combat. 

- Player will be able to dodge, stop time, lock to enemies, attack, and block.


<h3>Stop Time</h3>

- The player can use the character ability to stop time. Using this ability will stop everything, except for the character, creating opportunities for dodging attacks, changing positions, and stacking atttacks.

- This ability can be used by consuming player's character's life force, because their HP/Life is time. In this regard, players need to be careful to maximize the use of this ability without losing too much of their life force.
